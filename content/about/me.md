## Peter Mahon

**Digital & Technology Executive** · Abu Dhabi, UAE

---

I build technology functions that create value. Over 18 years, I've led enterprise-wide transformations across the Middle East and UK—turning complex digital possibilities into strategies that drive competitive advantage, operational excellence, and sustainable growth.

My philosophy is simple: technology should make money, save money, or reduce risk. Preferably all three.

### What I Do

I operate at the intersection of **business strategy**, **digital innovation**, and **cyber resilience**. Whether I'm presenting to boards, prototyping solutions, or redesigning operating models, my focus remains on building high-performance cultures that embrace change and deliver measurable outcomes.

**Strategic Leadership**  
Building technology departments from scratch, co-developing digital strategies, and influencing investment decisions at board level.

**IT Service Excellence**  
Designing and implementing ITIL-aligned service management frameworks, establishing governance structures, and driving operational maturity.

**Cybersecurity & Risk**  
Providing C-suite advisory on cyber resilience, conducting control assessments, and embedding security into operating models.

**Digital Transformation**  
Leading cloud migrations, modern workplace rollouts, and technology independence initiatives in regulated environments.

### Sector Experience

My career spans **regulated utilities** in Abu Dhabi's energy sector, **telecommunications** serving millions of customers in the UK, and **diversified conglomerates** across the Middle East. This breadth—combined with consulting experience advising boards on cybersecurity—means I understand complex operational and compliance challenges regardless of industry vertical.

### Beyond Work

I'm a Scout Leader in Abu Dhabi, running two groups and helping teach around 400 young people about digital citizenship and cybersecurity. Explaining phishing and password hygiene to a room full of ten-year-olds (and their parents) is a good reminder that if you can make technical concepts accessible to anyone, you can make them accessible to everyone.

It keeps me grounded and reminds me why this work matters beyond the boardroom.

I'm always interested in conversations about digital transformation, technology leadership, and building high-performing teams.
