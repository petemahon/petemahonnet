## Description

Sumptuous chutney-like jam chock-full of deep flavours. Perfect with almost anything.

## Ingredients

- 1kg bacon (I prefer half smoked, half unsmoked), sliced into very small pieces
- 1 bulb garlic / 10 cloves, finely chopped
- 2 medium/large brown onions
- 6 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- 500ml strong brewed coffee
- 150ml apple cider vinegar
- 150ml maple syrup
- Black pepper
- Extra water
- Tabasco or Sriracha sauce, to taste

## Instructions

1. Fry the bacon in four batches until lightly browned and beginning to crisp. Take the rendered bacon fat and keep to one side after each batch.
2. Put all the bacon fat back in the pan and fry the onion and garlic gently until translucent.
3. Transfer bacon, onion and garlic to a heavy-based pan and add everything else except the water. I tend to add the Tabasco and Sriracha towards the last half hour of cooking.
4. Simmer for 2 hours adding 50ml of water every 20 minutes and keep stirring from time to time.
5. Using a hand-held blender, pulse the mixture for a few seconds at a time until you reach a nice texture (personal preference is to eliminate bacon lumps and then stop).

## Notes

- Half smoked, half unsmoked bacon gives the best flavour balance
- Add the hot sauce in the last 30 minutes so you can adjust to taste
- Keeps for weeks in the fridge in air-tight jars
- Great on burgers, toast, or with cheese
