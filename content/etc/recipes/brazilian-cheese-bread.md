## Description

Chewy, cheesy Brazilian cheese bread (pão de queijo). Hard work but worth it. If you don't need all at once, freeze them after they've been shaped into balls for cooking at a later time.

## Ingredients

- 500g tapioca flour
- 320ml milk
- 125ml water
- 90ml olive oil
- 200g grated parmesan
- 150g shredded mozzarella
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp salt

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 210°C (or air fryer).
2. Combine the milk, water, oil and salt in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat.
3. Add the tapioca flour to a mixing bowl and pour in the milk mixture once it's boiling. Mix well until it becomes really white and sticky.
4. Add the eggs, one at a time. Keep mixing until combined — it takes a while.
5. Add the cheese, a little at a time, until fully mixed in. It should be very soft and very sticky.
6. Wet your hands with cold water and spoon some of the dough into your hands to shape balls a little smaller than golf balls.
7. Place the balls on a non-stick baking sheet and put in preheated oven.
8. Bake for 15–20 minutes or until golden and puffed. Air fryer takes about 8 minutes.

## Notes

- Freezer-friendly — freeze shaped balls for later, add 10 minutes to cooking time from frozen
- Wetting your hands with cold water helps with the sticky dough
- The mixing is hard work but keep going until fully combined
