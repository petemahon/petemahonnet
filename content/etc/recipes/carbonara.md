## Description

A rich and creamy carbonara with crispy bacon and plenty of parmesan.

## Ingredients

- 150g gluten-free spaghetti
- 6 slices back bacon, chopped
- 200ml double cream
- 200ml milk
- 2 large egg yolks
- 250g grated parmesan
- 1 tsp black pepper, freshly ground
- 1 fistful fresh basil, torn and stalks removed

## Instructions

1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, drain and set aside.
2. Add the bacon to a large heavy frying pan or skillet and sauté over low heat until crisp. Transfer bacon to some kitchen paper to absorb excess grease.
3. Add milk and cream to the pan and bring to a simmer. Whisk the egg yolks into the sauce, followed by the cheese. Stir in the black pepper. Taste for salt and season if needed.
4. Add spaghetti, bacon and basil to the skillet and toss well to combine.
5. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Serves 2 hungry people
- Taste the sauce before adding salt — the bacon and parmesan add plenty
- Serve immediately for best results
