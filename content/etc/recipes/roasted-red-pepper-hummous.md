## Description

5 minutes of prep for a lip-smacking hummous.

## Ingredients

- 2 roasted red peppers, or ½ jar
- 1 can chickpeas
- 60ml lemon juice, approx 1 large lemon
- 75ml tahini
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 30ml olive oil
- ½ tsp cumin
- 1 pinch cayenne pepper / hot sauce
- Salt, to taste

## Instructions

1. Grill quartered, de-seeded peppers for 5–10 minutes until the pepper skin has charred.
2. Add peppers to a bowl then cover with plastic wrap and wait 10–15 minutes. Gently peel away the charred pepper skin and discard. Reserve 1–2 pieces of the peeled roasted pepper to use as a garnish when serving, then roughly chop the rest.
3. In a processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice and process for 1 minute, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process for 30 seconds more. This extra time helps "whip" or "cream" the tahini, making the hummous smooth and creamy.
4. Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and some salt to the whipped tahini and lemon juice. Process for 30 seconds, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl then process another 30 seconds or until well blended.
5. Open, drain, and rinse the chickpeas. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape sides and bottom of the bowl, then add remaining chickpeas and process until thick and quite smooth; 1–2 minutes.
6. Add the roasted peppers and continue to process for 1–2 minutes or until smooth. If the hummus is too thick or still has tiny bits of chickpea, with the food processor turned on, slowly add 1–3 tablespoons of water until you are happy with the consistency.
7. Taste for salt and adjust as needed. Finely chop the reserved peppers. Spoon hummus into a bowl, make a small well in the middle and add the chopped peppers.

## Notes

- Can use jarred roasted peppers to save time
- Whipping the tahini first is the key to a smooth, creamy texture
- Store in an airtight container and refrigerate up to one week
