## Description

A simple tempura-style batter with bang bang sauce.

## Ingredients

### Battered Prawns
- 150g raw, peeled prawns
- 75g tapioca flour
- 1 egg
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Vegetable oil (for deep frying)

### Bang Bang Sauce
- 7 tbsp / 100ml mayonnaise
- 5 tbsp / 75ml sweet chilli sauce
- ½ tsp cayenne pepper (or more if needed)

## Instructions

1. Combine mayonnaise, sweet chilli sauce and cayenne pepper and set aside.
2. Put 25g flour into a bowl and the remainder into another bowl. Season both bowls with salt and pepper.
3. Break the egg into the smaller bowl and beat vigorously to make a smooth batter.
4. Heat the oil in a heavy pan or prepare a deep fat fryer.
5. Prepare large plate/baking tin covered in layers of kitchen paper.
6. Dip the prawns, one at a time, into the prepared batter then into the bowl of flour.
7. Carefully slide the prawns into the hot oil, a few at a time so the oil stays hot.
8. Cook the prawns for 2–4 minutes depending on the heat, turning over if necessary until they are golden all over.
9. Remove the cooked prawns onto the paper-lined plate/tray and keep warm.

## Notes

- Adjust cayenne pepper in the sauce to your preferred heat level
- Keep batches small so the oil stays hot
- Serve immediately while crispy
