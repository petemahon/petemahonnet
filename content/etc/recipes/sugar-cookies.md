## Description

Simple biscuits for using shapes etc.

## Ingredients

- 350g gluten-free flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- 200g caster/superfine sugar
- 170g butter, softened
- 1 tsp vanilla essence/extract
- 2 eggs

## Instructions

1. Whisk flour, salt and baking powder together.
2. Beat sugar, butter and vanilla separately.
3. Beat in eggs, one at a time, into the sugar/butter mixture until smooth.
4. Mix butter mixture into flour mixture and form into a ball.
5. Cover and refrigerate for an hour (or more if your room temp is high).
6. Preheat oven to 165°C.
7. Roll onto floured surface to approx 5–7mm thick and cut out using whichever shapes you like.
8. Arrange on baking sheet. They won't expand very much — leave about 1cm between them.
9. Cook for 10 minutes or until edges begin to brown. Even if they feel soft, they will harden once they cool.
10. Leave to cool on tray for 2 minutes before moving to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Notes

- Chill time is essential — at least 1 hour, longer if your kitchen is warm
- Don't worry if they feel soft out of the oven — they firm up as they cool
- Great for decorating with icing
