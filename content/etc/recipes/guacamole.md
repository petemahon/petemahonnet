## Description

This is lush with tortillas. I usually put extra garlic in but you can leave it overnight to let the flavours combine, if you want a stronger garlic taste without adding lots at the start.

## Ingredients

- 3 avocados, peeled and pitted
- 1 lime, juiced
- 3–4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 shallot, finely diced
- 2 plum tomatoes, finely diced
- 1 fistful fresh coriander, chopped
- 1 pinch ground cayenne pepper or a good dash of Tabasco sauce

## Instructions

1. Mix avocados, lime juice, garlic and salt in a blender until you get your preferred texture.
2. Add shallot, tomato and coriander and stir through.
3. Start small with the heat/spice until you hit the sweet spot.

## Notes

- Serves 3–4 depending on appetite
- Leave overnight for a stronger garlic flavour without adding more
- Tabasco works well as an alternative to cayenne
- Best served fresh with tortilla chips
