## Description

Sometimes I leave the chicken out of this and go nuts with extra mushrooms. Adapted from Natasha's Kitchen.

## Ingredients

- 300g chicken breast, cut into thin strips
- 150g pasta, gluten-free
- 500g white or brown mushrooms, thickly sliced (nearly 1cm thick)
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 4–6 cloves garlic, minced
- 100ml double cream
- 50ml milk
- 1 fistful parsley, finely chopped and stalks removed
- 1 tsp sea salt
- Plenty of freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 30ml olive oil
- 30g butter

## Instructions

1. Cook pasta in a pot of salted water, drain and set aside.
2. Season the chicken strips with salt and pepper (separate to the salt and pepper in the list above).
3. In a large heavy frying pan or skillet, heat 15ml olive oil and sauté chicken until lightly golden. Remove chicken from the pan and cover.
4. Add 15ml olive oil and butter to the pan. Add onion and sauté gently until soft.
5. Add sliced mushrooms and sauté gently until soft, stirring frequently.
6. Add garlic and sauté 30 seconds, stirring constantly.
7. Add milk and cream and simmer over medium heat until beginning to thicken.
8. Add chicken back to the pan, add the parsley and season sauce to taste.
9. Add cooked pasta and stir to combine. Heat until warmed through, remove from heat, cover and rest for 10 minutes before serving.

## Notes

- Serves 2 hungry people
- Works great as a vegetarian dish — skip the chicken and add extra mushrooms
- Rest time is important to let the flavours combine
