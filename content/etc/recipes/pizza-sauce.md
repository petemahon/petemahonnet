## Description

This is the base recipe I use. I usually make a lot more and freeze into large cubes for use later.

## Ingredients

- 30ml / 2 tbsp olive oil
- 30g / 1 tbsp butter
- ½ a large onion, finely chopped
- 5 large sticks celery, finely chopped
- 3 or 4 garlic cloves, minced
- 500g passata
- 135g tomato paste/purée (small box)
- 50g grated parmesan cheese
- 1 tsp dried basil
- 1 tsp dried oregano
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp sugar
- ½ tsp black peppercorns
- 1 small bay leaf
- 1.5 tsp fennel seed

## Instructions

1. In a large heavy frying pan or skillet, melt butter with the oil. Add the onion, celery and garlic and sauté until soft and transparent.
2. Grind the black peppercorns and fennel with the salt, but not to a powder.
3. Add passata and tomato paste and stir until smooth.
4. Add remaining ingredients and bring to slow simmer for 30–60 minutes (or not at all depending on your taste and time frame).
5. Remove the bay leaf and spread the sauce on your prepared pizza dough.

## Notes

- Freezes well — make extra and freeze in large cubes for later use
- Simmer time is flexible: 30–60 minutes depending on taste and time available
- Can skip the simmer entirely if short on time
