## Description

This doesn't have a lot of heat. I use it for 3–4 days afterwards and for everything — marinating, base paste for a stonking green curry etc. Gloves required for fresh turmeric handling. I add chopped fresh chillies to my curries so that this paste is good for the kids too.

## Ingredients

- ½ tsp whole coriander seed
- 1 tsp whole cumin seed
- ½ tsp whole black peppercorns
- 3 small green chillies (stems and seeds removed)
- 1 medium green bell pepper (stems and seeds removed)
- 5 cloves garlic, peeled
- 2 stalks lemongrass (tips trimmed, halved and chopped)
- 1 tbsp fresh sliced ginger
- 1 tbsp fresh sliced galangal
- 6 stalks scallions, sliced
- 1 tbsp fresh turmeric
- ½ tsp salt (plus more to taste)
- 50ml lemon juice (1 large lemon)
- 1 medium lime, zested and juiced
- 30ml avocado oil
- 15ml maple syrup or coconut sugar

## Instructions

1. Add whole coriander, cumin seeds and black peppercorns to a small heavy frying pan or skillet and toast over medium-low heat for 4–5 minutes, shaking/stirring occasionally, or until fragrant and slightly deeper in colour. Don't let it burn.
2. Once seeds are toasted, loosely crush in pestle and mortar. Set aside.
3. In your blender add green chillies, bell pepper, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, scallions, coriander, cumin, black pepper, turmeric, sea salt, lemon juice, lime zest and juice, oil, and maple syrup. Blend until a paste forms, scraping sides down as needed. The lemongrass is difficult to grind so give it time.
4. Taste and adjust flavour as needed: lime zest or juice for acidity, salt for saltiness, chillies for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, oil for creaminess, garlic for zing, ginger/galangal for brightness, turmeric for more intense curry flavour.
5. Store curry paste in a kilner jar in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks. Freezable.

## Notes

- Wear gloves when handling fresh turmeric — it stains
- Kid-friendly heat level — add fresh chillies when cooking for more heat
- Keeps for 3 weeks in the fridge, or freeze for longer
- Great for marinating or as a base for green curry
