## Description

This rich caramel needs to be carefully watched to avoid getting too dark. Covers approximately one large pot of popped popcorn — lightly salt the popcorn before mixing.

## Ingredients

- 225g salted butter
- 100g brown sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
- Large bowl of ready to eat popcorn

## Instructions

1. Melt butter in saucepan over medium heat.
2. Add sugar and stir until dissolved and mixed.
3. Stir continuously and bring gently up to a boil.
4. Cook for approximately 4–5 minutes without stirring on a lower heat.
5. Add vanilla at 3 min 30 second mark and stir to mix.
6. Add bicarbonate of soda at 4 min 30 second mark, take off the heat and stir thoroughly.
7. Drizzle over popcorn, folding mixture gently until all kernels are covered.
8. Cool before serving.

## Notes

- Watch the caramel carefully to avoid burning
- Lightly salt the popcorn before adding the caramel
- The bicarbonate of soda makes it foam up — be ready for it
