## Description

A rich and very tasty stroganoff showcasing wild mushrooms at their best. Use the freshest mushrooms you can get for maximum flavour.

## Ingredients

- 2 onions, finely chopped
- 5 sticks of celery, very finely chopped
- 60g butter
- 500g wild mushrooms (use different types such as morel, chanterelle etc), chopped to your liking
- ½ tsp dried mixed herbs
- ½ tsp dried basil
- 1 tbsp gluten-free flour (with xanthan gum)
- 275ml vegetable stock
- 100ml soured cream
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh chopped parsley

## Instructions

1. Fry the onions and celery in a heavy-based pan using the butter. Keep the heat low and fry for about 5 minutes in total. The onions should then be transparent and very soft.
2. Add the mushrooms and fry for about 3–4 minutes, or until the juice runs out of the mushrooms. Do not adjust the heat; keeping it low will seal in the flavour of the mushrooms.
3. Add in the herbs and basil and stir in.
4. Stir in the flour, making sure that you get rid of any lumps. If it is lumpy then beat vigorously. Cook for one minute.
5. Add stock and seasoning. Simmer for about 8–10 minutes.
6. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the soured cream. Taste and adjust the seasoning as required. Return to the hob and heat up to serving temperature.
7. Serve immediately onto warm bowls or plates. Garnish with fresh parsley.

## Notes

- **Do not let this boil** — it will impair the flavour
- Officially serves 6, but realistically serves 4
- Serve with rice or a heavy brown bread and salted butter
- Use the freshest wild mushrooms you can find — the variety makes this dish
